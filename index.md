# Welcome to My CS-499 ePortfolio
My name is Benjamin Mills and this is my ePortofolio which highlights my time and efforts at SNHU. This ePortfolio will take you through my personal journey in the Computer Science world from start to finish. You can expect to see 3 artifacts later on that highlight what I have learned and how I have improved throughout my time at SNHU.

## Introduction
I am a Computer Science Major at SNHU but that isn't where I started. Beginning in Highschool I found myself interested in technology, computers and programming were a major part of my life. I used computers for many aspects of my life but my biggest deciding factor on pursuing further education on them was my older brother. He was always participating in competitions but one that stuck out to me was a robotics competition where his team built a robot that could navigate an underwater maze. At the time I decided I would follow in his footsteps by getting the same degree in CS which led to me starting at a community college where I enrolled at AACC. I started in 2020 and finished in late 2022 with a Associate in Science in Computer Science. From there I spent my time completing certifications and continuing my learning as finacial setbacks prevented me from immediately starting on my Bachelors. Ultimately I decided on continuing my education where my oldest brother got his degree from, SNHU, in 2024.
