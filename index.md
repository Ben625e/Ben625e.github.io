# Welcome to My CS-499 ePortfolio
This is my ePortofolio which highlights my time and efforts at SNHU. This ePortfolio will take you through my personal journey in the Computer Science world from start to finish. You can expect to see 3 artifacts later on that highlight what I have learned and how I have improved throughout my time at SNHU.
