# Welcome to My CS-499 ePortfolio
My name is Benjamin Mills and this is my ePortofolio which highlights my time and efforts at SNHU. This ePortfolio will take you through my personal journey in the Computer Science world from start to finish. You can expect to see 3 artifacts later on that highlight what I have learned and how I have improved throughout my time at SNHU.

## Introduction
I am a Computer Science Major at SNHU but that isn't where I started. Beginning in Highschool I found myself interested in technology, computers and programming were a major part of my life. I used computers for many aspects of my life but my biggest deciding factor on pursuing further education on them was my older brother. He was always participating in competitions that I would get to see but one that stuck out to me was a robotics competition where his team built a robot that could navigate an underwater maze. At the time I decided I would follow in his footsteps by getting the same degree in CS which led to me starting at a community college where I enrolled at AACC. I started in 2020 and finished in late 2022 with a Associate in Science in Computer Science. From there I spent my time completing certifications and continuing my learning as finacial setbacks prevented me from immediately starting on my Bachelors. Ultimately I decided on continuing my education where my oldest brother got his degree from, SNHU, in 2024.

Coming into SNHU, I had the basics of programming from SNHU and developed IT concepts from my outside learning. So when I started I felt confident in my ability to code and thought that I would excell with ease. Not that my confidence was shattered but certainly was put to the test throughout my time at SNHU as new concepts I was unfamiliar with would pop up or what I thought I was good at actually had much room for improvements. I felt myself being challenged in my courses and the topics I knew at a surface level were discussed at a much deeper depth that often made me question if I would do well in once I leave the program. However, with challenge came a need to prove myself which continues to this day as I continue to improve myself and apply my knowledge in relevant ways.

My previous course work found on my Github help highlight my improvement through this course. I purposefully chose an older project for my artifacts to improve so my improvements are much clearly shown while also choosing a much more recent project to highlight my current skills. This ePortfolio will showcase my skills aquired through my time at SNHU by drawing attention to 3 specific artifacts but they are only a small portion of my talents as it does not include my outside learnings like my certifications or personal projects. Despite that, this ePortfolio will highlight my strengths in programming and specifically target concepts relating to Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.
